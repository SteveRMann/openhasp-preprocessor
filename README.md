## üéà Description <a name = "description"></a>

- This Python script allows you to manage each page of an OpenHASP display in separate files.
- The script also looks for possible errors that would prevent your page from loading into the panel.
- Managing page files is enhanced with comments and variables substitutions.

## üöÄ Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

### Preparation <a name = "preparation"></a>

1. Create a .src file in a pages folder for each page.  
For example **page2.src** is the **jsonl** code for everything that will appear on page 2.  
  
```
{
  "comment":" ------------------------- Page 2 - Temperatures -------------------------"
}

# ********** Page title **********
{
  "comment":"----- PageTitle",
  "page":2,"id":1,
  "obj":"btn",
  "x":120,"y":0,"w":240,"h":40,
  "text":"Temperatures","align":2,"value_font":22,
  "bg_opa":0,"text_color":"gray","radius":0,"border_side":0
}

# *************** Horizontal Line ***************
# 
{
  "comment":"----- Green Horizontal Line",
  "page": 2,"id": 12,
  "obj": "btn",
  "x": 10,"y": 45,"w": 470,"h": 2,
  "bg_color": "green",
  "bg_opa": 255,
  "border_width": 0
}

# ********** Attic label and temperature **********
{
  "comment":"----- Attic label",
  "page":2,"id":2,
  "obj":"label",
  "x":@p2-labels,"y":@p2-row1,"h":50,"w":200,"text":"Attic:","align":0,
  "bg_color":"#2C3E50","text_color":"#FFFFFF"
}

{
  "comment":"----- Attic Temperature data",
  "page":2,"id":3,
  "obj":"label",
  "x":@p2-values,"y":@p2-row1,"h":50,"w":200,"text":"p2b3","align":0,
  "text_color":"#FFFFFF"
}
```
**Notes**  
```
1. The x: and y: positions are populated with variables named @p2-labels, @p2-values and @p2-row1.  
The file: pages.ini (below) is where the variables are defined. (You can use any variable names).
Sounds like a lot of work, but it makes moving whole columns or rows of objects easy.
For example if I want all of my object labels to start on a different X position, I only have to
make a single change in the pages.ini file.  

2. Comments starting with a # are ignored in the processing  
```

2. Create a variables key:value file named **pages.ini**  
Example:  
```
# Page 1
@p1-labels:10
@p1-values:160
@p1-row1:180
@p1-row2:220
@p1-row3:260
@p1-row4:300

#Page 2
@p2-labels:10
@p2-values:180
@p2-row1:80
@p2-row2:120
@p2-row3:160
@p2-row4:200
@p2-row5:240
```

**Notes**  
```
1. Comments starting with a # are ignored in the processing  
```


**Execution**
1. In a cmd window, CD to the folder that contains **pages.py** and **pages.ini**.  
2. Run: python pages.py sample-pages  

The script pages.py will wrap all this up.  First it merges all of your page.src files into a single intermediate file, then makes the variable substitutions and outputs to the **pages.jsonl** file that you send to the panel.

---

### 1. void setPort(uint16_t portToUse) <a name = "setPort"></a>

Change the port number of this Telnet server. If a client is already connected, it will be disconnected.

Default: 23

```
void setPort(uint16_t portToUse)
```

### 2. void setWelcomeMsg(char* msg) <a name = "setWelcomeMsg"></a>

Change the message which will be sent to the Telnet client after a session is established.

Default: "Connection established via TelnetSpy.\n"

```
void setWelcomeMsg(char* msg)
```

### 3. void setRejectMsg(char* msg) <a name = "setRejectMsg"></a>

Change the message which will be sent to the Telnet client if another session is already established.

Default: "TelnetSpy: Only one connection possible.\n"

```
void setRejectMsg(char* msg)
```

### 4. void setMinBlockSize(uint16_t minSize) <a name = "setMinBlockSize"></a>

Change the amount of characters to collect before sending a Telnet block.

Default: 64 

```
void setMinBlockSize(uint16_t minSize)
```

### 5. void setCollectingTime(uint16_t colTime) <a name = "setCollectingTime"></a>

Change the time (in ms) to wait before sending a Telnet block if it's size is less than <minSize> (defined by ```setMinBlockSize```).

Default: 100

```
void setCollectingTime(uint16_t colTime)
```

### 6. void setMaxBlockSize(uint16_t maxSize) <a name = "setMaxBlockSize"></a>

Change the maximum size of the Telnet packets to send.

Default: 512

```
void setMaxBlockSize(uint16_t maxSize)
```

### 7. bool setBufferSize(uint16_t newSize) <a name = "setBufferSize"></a>

Change the size of the ring buffer. Set it to ```0``` to disable buffering. Changing size tries to preserve the already collected data. If the new buffer size is too small, only the latest data will be preserved. Returns ```false``` if the requested buffer size cannot be set.

Default: 3000

```
bool setBufferSize(uint16_t newSize)
```

### 8. uint16_t getBufferSize() <a name = "getBufferSize"></a>

This function returns the actual size of the ring buffer.

```
uint16_t getBufferSize()
```

### 9. void setStoreOffline(bool store) <a name = "setStoreOffline"></a>

Enable / disable storing new data in the ring buffer if no Telnet connection is established. This function allows you to store important data only. You can do this by disabling ```storeOffline``` for sending unimportant data.

Default: true

```
void setStoreOffline(bool store)
```

### 10. bool getStoreOffline() <a name = "getStoreOffline"></a>

Get actual state of storing data when offline.

```
bool getStoreOffline()
```

### 11. void setPingTime(uint16_t pngTime) <a name = "setPingTime"></a>

If no data is sent via TelnetSpy, the detection of a disconnected client has a long timeout. Use ```setPingTime``` to define the time (in ms) without traffic after which a ping aka a ```chr(0)``` is sent to the Telnet client to detect a disconnect earlier. Use ```0``` as parameter to disable pings.

Default: 1500  

```
void setPingTime(uint16_t pngTime)
```

### 12. void setSerial(HardwareSerial* usedSerial) <a name = "setSerial"></a>

Set the serial port you want to use with this object (especially for ESP32) or ```NULL``` if no serial port should be used (Telnet only).

Default: Serial

```
void setSerial(HardwareSerial* usedSerial)
```

### 13. bool isClientConnected() <a name = "isClientConnected"></a>

This function returns true if a Telnet client is connected.

```
bool isClientConnected()
```

### 14. void setCallbackOnConnect(void (*callback)()) <a name = "setCallbackOnConnect"></a>

This function installs a callback function which will be called on every Telnet connect of this object (except rejected connect tries). Use ```NULL``` to remove the callback.

Default: NULL

```
void setCallbackOnConnect(void (*callback)())
```

### 15. void setCallbackOnDisconnect(void (*callback)()) <a name = "setCallbackOnDisconnect"></a>

This function installs a callback function which will be called on every Telnet disconnect of this object (except rejected connect tries). Use ```NULL``` to remove the callback.

Default: NULL

```
void setCallbackOnDisconnect(void (*callback)())
```

## üí° Hint <a name = "hint"></a>

Add the following lines to your sketch:

```
TelnetSpy SerialAndTelnet;
#define SERIAL SerialAndTelnet
// #define SERIAL Serial
```

Replace ```Serial``` with ```SERIAL``` in your sketch. Now you can switch between serial only and serial with Telnet by only changing the comments of the defines.
 
## üîî Important <a name = "important"></a>

- To connect to the Telnet server you have to:
    1. Establish the WiFi connection.
    2. Execute ```SerialAndTelnet.begin(WhatEverYouWant)```.
 
üí° **Note:** The order is not important.

- Everything you do with ```Serial```, you can do with ```TelnetSpy``` too. But remember: Transfering data also via Telnet will need more performance than the serial port only. So time critical things may be influenced.

- It is not possible to establish more than one Telnet connection at the same time. But it's possible to use more than one instance of TelnetSpy.

- If you have problems with low memory, you may reduce the value of the ```define TELNETSPY_BUFFER_LEN``` for a smaller ring buffer on initialisation.    

- Usage of ```void setDebugOutput(bool)``` to enable / disable of capturing of os_print calls when you have more than one TelnetSpy instance: That TelnetSpy object will handle this functionality where you used ```setDebugOutput``` at last.
On default, TelnetSpy has the capturing of OS_print calls enabled. So if you have more instances the last created instance will handle the capturing.
